Breakpoints</h2> <p>Simplechart is designed to draw charts with a fixed height and variable width. Sometimes, this requires special handling for different screen sizes, e.g. desktop vs. mobile. The <strong>Breakpoints</strong> feature allows you to specify the chart&#39;s height depending on the available width of the screen or page design.</p> <p>The default breakpoint sets a height of 400 pixels at all screen widths. At that height, a chart might look like this on a desktop monitor:</p> <p><img src=http://simplechart.io/lib/images/help-docs/breakpoints/embed_desktop_400.png alt=\\\"400px chart height on desktop\\\"></p> <p>And this on a mobile device:</p> <p><img alt=\\\"400px chart height on mobile\\\" src=http://simplechart.io/lib/images/help-docs/breakpoints/embed_mobile_400.png style=max-width:225px!important /></p> <p>If you wanted the chart to take up less of the screen on mobile devices, here&#39;s how you would change the height to 250 pixels on devices up to 400 pixels wide:</p> <p><img src=http://simplechart.io/lib/images/help-docs/breakpoints/adding_breakpoint.gif alt=\\\"Adding a breakpoint\\\"></p> <p>Now, the chart looks like this:</p> <p><img alt=\\\"250px chart height on mobile\\\" src=http://simplechart.io/lib/images/help-docs/breakpoints/embed_mobile_250.png style=max-width:225px!important /></p> <p>We did this by:</p> <ol> <li>Clicking the green &quot;Add Breakpoint&quot; button</li> <li>Setting the max width to <code>400</code></li> <li>Setting the height to <code>250</code></li> </ol> <p>After those steps, the chart has two breakpoints:</p> <ul> <li>Regardless of screen width, <strong>Breakpoint 1</strong> sets the <em>height</em> to 400 pixels.</li> <li>On screens up to 400 pixels wide, <strong>Breakpoint 2</strong> supersedes Breakpoint 1 and reduces the height to 250 pixels.</li> </ul> \";\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ 451:\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\nmodule.exports = \"<h2 id=metadata>Metadata</h2> <p>Metadata – including title, subtitle, caption, and credit – can be entered in the <strong>Data Input</strong> (title only) or <strong>Settings</strong> steps.

Sometimes, this requires special handling for different screen sizes, e.g. desktop vs. mobile. The <strong>Breakpoints</strong> feature allows you to specify the chart&#39;s height depending on the available width of the screen or page design.</p> <p>The default breakpoint sets a height of 400 pixels at all screen widths. At that height, a chart might look like this on a desktop monitor:</p> <p><img src=http://simplechart.io/lib/images/help-docs/breakpoints/embed_desktop_400.png alt=\\\"400px chart height on desktop\\\"></p> <p>And this on a mobile device:</p> <p><img alt=\\\"400px chart height on mobile\\\" src=http://simplechart.io/lib/images/help-docs/breakpoints/embed_mobile_400.png style=max-width:225px!important /></p> <p>If you wanted the chart to take up less of the screen on mobile devices, here&#39;s how you would change the height to 250 pixels on devices up to 400 pixels wide:</p> <p><img src=http://simplechart.io/lib/images/help-docs/breakpoints/adding_breakpoint.gif alt=\\\"Adding a breakpoint\\\"></p> <p>Now, the chart looks like this:</p> <p><img alt=\\\"250px chart height on mobile\\\" src=http://simplechart.io/lib/images/help-docs/breakpoints/embed_mobile_250.png style=max-width:225px!important /></p> <p>We did this by:</p> <ol> <li>Clicking the green &quot;Add Breakpoint&quot; button</li> <li>Setting the max width to <code>400</code></li> <li>Setting the height to <code>250</code></li> </ol> <p>After those steps, the chart has two breakpoints:</p> <ul> <li>Regardless of screen width, <strong>Breakpoint 1</strong> sets the <em>height</em> to 400 pixels.</li> <li>On screens up to 400 pixels wide, <strong>Breakpoint 2</strong> supersedes Breakpoint 1 and reduces the height to 250 pixels.</li> </ul> \";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./app/pages/help/breakpoints.md\n// module id = 450\n// module chunks = 1","module.exports = \"<h2 id=metadata>Metadata</h2> <p>Metadata – including title, subtitle, caption, and credit – can be entered in the <strong>Data Input</strong> (title only) or <strong>Settings</strong> steps.
